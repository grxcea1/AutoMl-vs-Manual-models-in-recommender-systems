# AutoMl-vs-Manual-models-in-recommender-systems
**Overview**

This project develops a modular and extensible recommender system as part of a Final Year Project. The goal is to design, implement, and evaluate multiple collaborative filtering algorithms within a structured pipeline.

Different models are trained and compared using standard evaluation metrics, and the best-performing model is selected and integrated into a reusable Python-based library. The final outcome is a clean, organized recommender system that can be easily extended or adapted.

**Project Objectives**

Implement multiple collaborative filtering algorithms

Evaluate and compare model performance using RMSE and MAE

Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy

Design and build a modular recommender pipeline

Develop a reusable Python recommendation library

Provide justification for model selection based on experimental results

**Methodology**

The project follows a structured experimental approach:

Data preprocessing and formatting

Train-test data splitting

Training multiple recommendation algorithms

Evaluating performance using standard metrics

Hyperparameter tuning of the best-performing model

Integrating the selected model into a custom recommendation pipeline
